                    <h4>History</h4>
                    <p>Bilton Cricket Club was formed in the 1890’s and played cricket near Knox Lane in Harrogate before moving to a field near St John’s Church in Bilton in the early 1920’s. In 1952, after several years of enthusiastic fund raising, the club purchased its present ground on Bilton Lane. Up to the late 1970’s the club premises consisted of a wooden pavillion and a prefabricated building which was used as the clubhouse. The original pavillion is still in use today serving to store junior cricket equipment. </p>
                    <p>In 1979 the club built its new brick built clubhouse, which included new changing facilities. Three further refurbishments, extensions and a rear verandah, completed proior to the 2013 season, provide what we consider to be the finest clubhouse in the Harrogate District. Full kitchen facilities enable the club to provide its renowned catering to players and private hire functions. All improvements are paid for by funds generated by the club and its members.</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="reasons col-sm-6">
                    <h4>Ground and Facilities</h4>
                    <p> The cricket ground on Bilton Lane is one of the best kept and truest in the area, it is maintained to a very high standard by the full time groundsman Mr Russell Hutchinson. 
                    The ground is so well thought of by other organisations. The club often hosts the Airedale and Wharfedale Senior League premier cup final known as the Waddilove Cup, Yorkshire Schools boys & girls county matches, and other cup finals in the local area. The club has full disabled facilities which have been in place for many years.</p>

                    <h4>Members</h4>
                    <p> The club has over 700 members of various categories including over 70 Junior Cricket Members and 100 senior citizens, who come along, not only for the cricket, but for the bingo, dominoes, numerous quizzes and other activities that the club organises for all its members. The club has an ever increasing level of membership with new members joining all the time.</p>
